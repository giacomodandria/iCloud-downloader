# iCloud-downloader
Download (shared) albums from iCloud using the sharable link.

Execute the script on a Linux machine (or WSL) by running the command

```
bash icloud-album-download.sh <URL> <target folder>
```

in the folder where the file is located. `<URL>` is the sharable URL generated by Apple Photos and `<target folder>` is the path to the folder where the files need to be saved.

NOTE: to run the script `jq` is needed; to install it (in Ubuntu) run the following command

```
sudo apt-get install jq
```
