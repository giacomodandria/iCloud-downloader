# iCloud-downloader
Download (shared) albums from iCloud using the sharable link.

Execute the script on a Linux machine (or WSL) by running the command

```
bash iCloud-downloader.sh <URL> <target folder>
```

in the folder where the file is located. `<URL>` is the sharable URL generated by Apple Photos and `<target folder>` is the path to the folder where the files need to be saved.

NOTE: to run the script `jq` is needed; to install it (in Ubuntu) run the following command

```
sudo apt-get install jq
```

For other distros take a look at [this](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) website.

# Copying photos from WSL to Windows

In order to move the downloaded photos in the Linux VM on Windows we can open a new File Explorer window and type in the address bar

```
\\wsl$\<WSL Distro>
```

where `<WSL Distro>` is the Linux distribution used in WSL. For example, if WSL is running Ubuntu, the previous command is

```
\\wsl$\Ubuntu
```

We can now access the files inside the VM by navigating to `Home` -> `<User>` -> `<target folder>`.

The files can now be copied from that folder to the desired one.
